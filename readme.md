# Glauber Dynamics on Percolated Lattices

This repo holds the code for my Master Thesis on Glauber Dynamics [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glauber_dynamics)

I have set up three different way to similate it

- Pure Python with NumPy (`/python `)
- Pre-Compiled Python with Numba(`/python `)
- C++ with a Python Wrapper (`/c++ `)
